    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Over 40% of the world’s population lives within 100 km of the coastline.\n",
    "However, coastal environments are constantly changing, with erosion and coastal change presenting a major challenge to valuable coastal infrastructure and important ecological habitats.\n",
    "Updating data on the position of the coastline is essential for coastal managers to be able to identify and minimise the impacts of coastal change and erosion. \n",
    "The coastal regions are also home to many wetlands. Monitoring of water extent helps to understand and protect these dynamic and productive ecosystems.\n",
    "\n",
    "While coastlines and water extents can be mapped using optical data (demonstrated in the [Coastal Erosion notebook](../Real_world_examples/Coastal_erosion.ipynb)), these images can be strongly affected by the weather, especially through the presence of clouds, which obscure the land and water below.\n",
    "This can be a particular problem in cloudy regions or areas where clouds in wet season prevent optical satellites from taking clear images for many months of the year.\n",
    "\n",
    "Radar observations are largely unaffected by cloud cover.\n",
    "The two Sentinel-1 satellites, operated by ESA as part of the Copernicus program, provide all-weather observations every 6 to 12 days over Africa.\n",
    "By developing a process to classify the observed pixels as either water or land, it is possible to identify the shoreline and map the dynamic water extents using radar data.\n",
    "For more information, see the [Sentinel-1](../Datasets/Sentinel_1.ipynb) notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we use data from the Sentinel-1 satellites to build a classifier that can determine whether a pixel is a water or land.\n",
    "Specifically, this notebook uses analysis-ready radar backscatter, which describes the strength of the signal received by the satellite.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook contains the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load Sentinel-1 backscatter data for an area of interest and visualize the returned data\n",
    "2. Applying speckle filter and converting the digital numbers to dB values for analysis\n",
    "3. Use histogram analysis to determine the threshold for water classification\n",
    "4. Design a classifier to distinguish land and water\n",
    "5. Apply the classifier to the area of interest and interpret the results\n",
